## About:
This challenge was to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards by "cleaning up" the html and css files.

## Changes: 
* HTML semantic elements to added to replace div elements
* Added **alt-""** to HTML img elements to indicate that they're decorative
* Changed title element to *Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.*
* Icons put above each benefit for greater readability in right-side column
* CSS stylesheet modifications
    * Ordered to match HTML semantic structure
    * Combined repeated styles into common rulesets
    * Minor stylistic modifications (ex. shadow on h1's span)
* Comments added throughout for improved codebase long term stability
* Created dummy index.html file in root directory that automatically links to webpage
* Pushed live website to GitHub Pages
